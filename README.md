## Welcome to Quaoar's support site


**Quaoar** is a discord.py for MyAnimeList.net, currently capable of:
- searching for specific anime and providing some information about it
- displaying the top anime on MAL

# Commands
The command prefix for Quaoar is **&**. The commands are:
- &search (anime)
The search anime displays information from MAL about an anime. The command currently only works if the exact name as it is on MAL is used (this will hopefully be changed in the future) for example "&search tokyo ghoul" will work but "&search ghoul" will not return any anime.
- &top (amount)
The top command displays the top anime on MAL, up to the amount specified. For example &top 5 shows the top five.
and, lastly
- &printhelp
The printhelp command pretty much displays a condensed version of this page in the channel the command was invoked.
